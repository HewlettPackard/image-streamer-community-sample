# ToDo list 

This list has no priority order.

* Test and validate SLES 12 and SLE 15 with minimum PS and PBs

* Create SUSE-Readme.md

* Port to UEFI paradigm/create/split users and root change passwd Plan Scripts (Ubuntu best practice is to have no root passwd.)

* Port to UEFI paradigm the multiple NICs (no bond) Plan Script

* Port to Legacy and UEFI paradigms the network with bond Plan Scripts

* Tests, tests, tests

* Investigate a way to avoid the RC-FILE modification during the first and initial OS deployment/configuration in the UEFI paradigm. Meaning the insertion of the execution of the /boot/efi/EFI/HPE/isdeploy/HPE-ImageStreamer.bash script.
